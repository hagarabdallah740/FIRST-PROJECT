                    Jeannette Pickering Rankin (June 11, 1880 – May 18, 1973) was an American 
                    politician and women's rights advocate, and the first woman to hold federal 
                    office in the United States. She was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as

                     Women's political participation is a fundamental prerequisite for gender equality and genuine democracy. 
                     It facilitates women's direct engagement in public decision-making and is a means of ensuring better 
                     accountability to women.

                    London-born Ada Lovelace (1815–1852) had a passion and gift for mathematics 
                    from a young age. She is credited with being the world's first computer programmer,

                <P>
                    Female role models are important for ambitious women. If we can't look up and see women who have been
                     successful, we are less likely to be successful ourselves. The presence of women in leadership positions
                      and the opportunity to network with them is vital to helping motivate women to advance in their careers.
